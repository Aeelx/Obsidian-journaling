> [!important] Hey there, **welcome back!**
> Just an introduction with a simple checkmark for that small dopamine boost but not before making you aware of how you have completed the journal entry while scrolling up

> [!example] How are you feeling today?
> This is for setting the stage/to start to put down the general direction of today

> [!example] What emotions did you feel the most today?
> This is useful to track the trend of emotions so you can see how coping techniques are doing over a certain period, or maybe if a lifestyle is or isn't for you

> [!example] How would you rate today?
> This is for adding context to what happened today, maybe during the day you felt happy but you think that overall the day was stressful, even if you were happy, or maybe you felt sad because something happened but it was still productive

> [!example] How do you feel phisically?
> This is for tracking overall physical health and conditions in time, and maybe finding correlations between mental and physical health

> [!example] How hard was (or would) it be to brush your teeth?
> This is for mainly tracking your will-power, brushing your teeth is something that can be easily achieved with that much effort but that has almost 0 immediate negative consequences and so is difficult to justify in the moment, especially if you're temporally myopic

> [!cite] If you feel like it, Write here something about your day *(If unsure start with something like: How did you feel today, What did you learn, What bothered you, What made you happy or sad, What did you achieve)*
> This is the freestyle classic part of journaling, just writing down what you have in mind at a slow-er pace so you can also ruminate on what is that you are thinking
