# üìì Experimental journaling template for obsidian
#### This is designed to be a bit different from usual journaling techniques to hopefully cover better different people with different needs

- [Download the latest template](https://github.com/Aeelx/Obsidian-journaling/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and put it in your preferred location 
- [Download Obsidian if you haven't already](https://obsidian.md/download) (Alternatives are discussed in [#Obsidian alternatives])
- Open the folder in obsidian and enjoy!
- (Optional) Read the rest of the readme and "Explanation of modules" while in obsidian

Happy journaling :) ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Obsidian alternatives (WIP)
I personally think that Obsidian is a great tool all around but i can understand that not everybody feels the same, as this is the case, here are alternatives to consider
### Joplin
Everything should work, to add template functionality you can use https://joplinapp.org/plugins/plugin/joplin.plugin.templates/
### Stackedit
Not recommended for this but it works if you want something online first
https://stackedit.io/

#### Heads up
Notesnook, Standard notes, Logseq, Siyuan, Zettlr, and QOwnNotes

In my experience none of them work with this template or i found them extremely not straight-forward to setup and use, Maybe in the future i will add different templates that work
# Keeping schedule (WIP)

Consider using an app like [Tick Tick](https://www.ticktick.com) to set reminders everyday

An alarm works too though, often less is more

# Syncing and backing up (WIP)

### Obsidian sync (Official)
Paid but arguably the best option
https://obsidian.md/sync
### Remotely save
You can sync your files on the cloud via a free account like dropbox, has E2E encryption, slightly convoluted to setup but pretty good when setup
https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save
### Resilio sync
Third party and external service but it gets the job done
https://www.resilio.com/sync/
