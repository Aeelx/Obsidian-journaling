#### This is designed to be a bit different from usual journaling techniques to hopefully cover better different people with different needs
###### It's a starting point that can be modified by you to fit your needs better if you don't feel it's doing it already

# ‚è∞ Keeping a schedule
Keeping a schedule is not necessary but could be useful if you want to make it a habit\
There are multiple app to help you do so(An alarm works too though)

- [HabitKit](https://www.habitkit.app) is probably the simplest one, just notifications and tracking. Only on Android/IOS
- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home) has similar features to HabitKit, but is way more gameified. Web/Android/IOS Open source
- [Tick Tick](https://www.ticktick.com) has a good habit tracker too but i would mainly reccomend it if you also want the other task management features. Multi-platform


# üíæ Syncing and backing up (WIP)

### Obsidian sync (Official)
Paid but arguably the best option
https://obsidian.md/sync
### Remotely save
You can sync your files on the cloud via a free account like dropbox, has E2E encryption, slightly convoluted to setup but pretty good when setup
https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save
### Resilio sync
Third party and external service but it gets the job done
https://www.resilio.com/sync/

# Obsidian alternatives (WIP)
I personally think that Obsidian is a great tool all around but i can understand that not everybody feels the same, as this is the case, here are alternatives to consider
### Joplin
Everything should work, to add template functionality you can use https://joplinapp.org/plugins/plugin/joplin.plugin.templates/
### Stackedit
Not recommended for this but it works if you want something online first
https://stackedit.io/

#### Heads up
Notesnook, Standard notes, Logseq, Siyuan, Zettlr, and QOwnNotes

In my experience none of them work with this template or i found them extremely not straight-forward to setup and use, Maybe in the future i will add different templates that work with other apps
